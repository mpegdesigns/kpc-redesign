 <p>Gary and Mary Reid were called to missionary service and left for Kenya in July 2000.</p>
<p>Their first place of work was at the <a href="http://www.pcimissionoverseas.org/partners/item/3/presbyterian-church-of-east-africa-pcea/" title="PCEA">Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA)</a> Chogoria Hospital where Gary was involved with the overseeing of the rehabilitation of the hospital water system and Mary home schooled their oldest child. &#160;</p>
<p>From here they moved in October 2001 to PCEA Honi Farm where Gary built water reservoirs and completed a water project that had been started for the church and the local community. During this time, children&#8217;s clubs were held at their home and an English morning service for young people was held in the local church. Gary also taught on Sunday mornings at a local orphanage.</p>
<p>In 2005, Gary and Mary, along with their four children, started a work amongst the Maasai people based in Olkinyei&#160;in the Narok District of Southwest Kenya. They are working with the LimuruPresbytery&#160;of the&#160;PCEA, in the spiritual heartland of the Maasai tribe. Here Mary continued to home school their children, whilst helping Gary in the building of the Mission Station, known as PCEA Acacia Grove Mission.Three of their children are now at boarding scholl and Mary continues to home school the youngest.</p>
<p>On Sundays Gary teaches in the established churches, and on Saturdays at the Bible Study held on the Mission. Throughout the year he also teaches the different levels of the Worship Leaders&#8217; Courses.</p>
<p>The Mission works with the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Development, Children&#8217;s Department in Narok, helping vulnerable children who have suffered, or were threatened, with abuse, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), child labour and neglect. They also help women who have been abused, and provide refuge at the Mission when this is required. Furthermore, they encourage the preservation and care of God&#8217;s creation.</p>
<p>They are involved in promoting the education of the whole child, and are seeking to provide books (especially Christian writings and literature) to children within the local nursery and primary schools.</p>
<p>During the school holidays they organise Bush Bible Clubs and Fun Days where the children (and members of the community) have fun together, enjoy snacks and learn about God&#8217;s love for them.</p>
<p>The distribution of God&#8217;s Word continues, as does the provision of water tanks encouraging rain catchment.</p>
<p>In times of drought, they distribute food to malnourished children and poor families, and when required they transport seriously ill or injured people to one of the local dispensaries, or larger hospitals - the closest being over 75 kms away.</p>
<p>Despite many difficulties (physical, cultural and spiritual), there&#8217;s much to be encouraged about and give thanks for, as God by His Holy Spirit continues to build His Kingdom among the Maasai in the area.<br /><br /><strong>READ their latest <a href="http://www.pcimissionoverseas.org/people/monthly-bulletins/" title="Monthly Bulletins">Monthly Bulletin</a> which gives up to date news and prayer requests.</strong></p>
